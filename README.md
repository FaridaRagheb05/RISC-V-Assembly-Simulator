# RISC-V-Assembly-Simulator

RISC-V Simulator

Project Description

    The RISC-V Simulator is a program designed to simulate the execution of basic RISC-V assembly instructions. It processes a sequence of instructions read from a text file, performs the corresponding operations on registers, and updates the Program Counter (PC) accordingly. This simulation provides a step-by-step execution of arithmetic, logical, shift, and branch instructions.

Key features of the simulator include:

    Arithmetic Operations: Support for basic instructions like ADD and AND to perform arithmetic and logical operations between registers.
    
    Shift Operations: Includes both arithmetic and logical shifts such as SRA, SRLI, and SLLI.
    
    Branch Instructions: The simulator handles conditional branching with instructions like BLTU (branch if less than unsigned) and BGEU (branch if greater than or equal unsigned).
    
    Program Counter and Registers: The program counter (PC) is updated based on instruction execution, and register values are updated after each operation.

The RISC-V Simulator aims to provide an educational tool for understanding the inner workings of a RISC-V processor, focusing on how instructions affect register values, the PC, and overall processor state.
